<h2 class=”modesandDiffs”> <ins>The Story, Game Modes & Difficulty Levels</ins></h2>
The game’s story progresses through 20 main flags (green solo story, blue solo/co-op story) and several additional flags (purple solo/co-op staged battles, black solo/co-op boss battles) tied to the main story flags, plus there are two unique flags (orange eternal battle solo/co-op staged battles, red PVP).
You start the game in “Normal Mode.”  Once you have completed the first 18 main flags (most people are surprised by how easy it is to defeat Drall), you are given the option of moving to “Hardcore Mode”.   If you choose not to do so at that time, you can always do so from the Character menu.  However, there is no real reason not to switch.  After that, you can complete the last 2 main flags, although you don’t have to complete flag 20: Spirit Temple in order to restart in Hardcore.  Hardcore isn’t really that much harder than normal, except for on the higher levels and special flags.

As a rule of thumb, once you’ve completed hardcore, you’ll be able to join in FFA & TDM with any high level player, whereas before that you will almost never be able to successfully join (unless your DPS is very high) with anyone outside of about +/-10 levels of you.

You’ll notice when you start playing that each level has 5 stars on the map, but only one star is golden.  Once you complete normal mode, you’ll be able to select the level of difficulty for any flag: normal, elite, heroic, legendary, or godlike, and each difficulty will show the suggested character level for it, although this won’t apply if you’ve done well in developing your character’s skills and equipment.  Each difficulty level has its own objectives, which you can view by touching the map in the top-right corner of the level screen, which will also show the map of the level – at least, as much of it as you’ve explored (including from previous attempts).
