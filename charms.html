<h3 class=”charms”>Charms</h3>
	<p>Please see my Charms table for technical info.</p>

	<h4>Standard</h4>
	<p>These are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><ins>Circular</ins></li>: fortitude, power, agility, arcana,
		<li><ins>Square</ins></li>: wisdom, heart, soul, bandit,
		<li><ins>Triangular</ins></li>: agility, ghost, monk, mind,
		<li><ins>Star</ins></li>: winter, storm, soldier, blessing,

	<h4>Special</h4>
	<p>These are: monk, ghost, essence and scavenger, and the hexagonal charms are exclusive.  You should always keep these if you get them as they are very useful, except the latter.</p>

	<h4>Hexagonal</h4>
	<p>You will probably find ONE item (usually leg armor) with a hexagonal charm slot in it early in playing DH4 with any given character, and you will be able to add 3 other slots to it.  Do not hold onto this waiting for hex charms – they are only available within the gold chest.  You can’t even get them as a gift.</p>
