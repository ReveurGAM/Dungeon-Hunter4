<h2 class=”chests”>Chests of Fate</h2>
You may sometimes see system notes during loads that mention wheels and lotteries.  These don’t exist anymore – but there are still the bronze, silver and gold chests within the “Chest of Fate”, which you can access from the menu at the top of the World Map and the Challenges Screen.  These chests are basically gambling – you can spend huge sums of gems and not get what you want (e.g. you get the armor you want but with the wrong charm slots); it can be extremely frustrating and some players won’t talk about how much they’ve wasted.
The gold chest is the most expensive (1 chance for 500 gems, 6 for 2,500), but it offers the chance of winning great prizes, such as the best armor (Leviathan - tier 103) and hexagonal charms.  You get ONE free draw from this chest for each character.
The silver chest is less expensive (1 draw for 200 and 6 for 1,000 respectively), and offers very nice armor (Crimson – tier 97), special charms (essence, ghost, monk and scavenger) and expensive potions.
The bronze chest is inexpensive (1 draw for 50 and 5 for 250) and has a variety of gifts: special and normal charms that are rare, elixirs and potions, and the coveted book of skills (which gives you 2 skill points).  You get one free draw per day, but it is not exactly cumulative; if you miss a day or two, you will get more than one draw that day, but after a period of time.  Most of the time, you’ll get common charms and potions but, every once in a while (almost weekly), you’ll get the book and, less often, you’ll get an elixir, and super rarely a special charm.  Be careful NOT to draw when you have less than the maximum number of health potions as, most often, the chest will give you a health potion.

You will sometimes get this from the bronze chest.  Use it right away to get two extra skill points!
