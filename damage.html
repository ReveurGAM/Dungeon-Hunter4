There are two different classes of damage: immediate and delayed.
Immediate: lightning, radiant, ice and damage bonuses.
Delayed: poison (over 4 seconds), bleed (over 3 seconds), fire (over 2 seconds).  These do not “stack” with other types of damage.
Some of these increase your DPS a lot, some a little, and they affect different types of monsters differently.  For example, ice will not be very effective on cold region monsters (kenashi, ravagers, wolves, lupines) whereas fire will.  Radiant is most effective against the undead and demons.
