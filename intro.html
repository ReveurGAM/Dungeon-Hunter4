<article class=”intro”>
    			<p><br/><br/>Game Loft’s 4th in the mobile RPG series )(available on both <em>Apple</em> and <em>Android</em>) used to be a popular game but, with the release of DH5, Game Loft has neglected it severely as it focuses on milking the cash out of DH5.  Unfortunately, DH5 is at least as glitchy as DH4, if not moreso, so I wasn’t even able to run it on my iPad.  There are still people playing DH4, but it is hard to tell how many people there are because the game doesn’t require you to log into GL or Facebook, and your name can be assigned by either your device or by using the skip button, so one person can use any number of screennames.</p>
					<p><ins>Older players are becoming rare</ins>:  in the time I’ve been playing, I’ve seen several long-term players disappear out of frustration over typical MPRPGs:  disloyalty, selfishness, trolling, mimicking another user’s screen name, immaturity, hacking the game, and so on.  MerlionROARS aka EugeneEngine aka Canicanican3 aka…was a frequent benefactor for other players, but he quit the end of 2017.  A month or two before that, Grrr left, then AlytheWitch, and it appears that LizzzvonLipwig has left, while Bernd Thielert and Mithgar Nim almost never play now.</p>
					<p><ins>Some old players HAVE returned</ins>: LordVictor and nothinMatters, for example.</p>
					<p><ins>Several remain</ins>: like Thea_Gelo and evan.</p>
					<p><ins>International popularity</ins>:  Also, the players represent an array of nations from every continent except Antarctica: the USA, Canada, the UK, France, Switzerland, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, Brazil, Ecuador, Australia, Russia and more!</p>
					<p>Numerous <strong>glitches</strong> and problem exist in the game, at least on the Apple server.</p>
					<p class=”credits”><strong>Many thanks</strong> to Grrr, Bernd, Gene, Lizzz, Thea and evan (and a few others) for the information they shared with me which, along with what I learned by playing and a bit from the DH4 FAQs, is the basis of this webpage.   Thanks go to them (and several others!) for not just the information they shared,  but the time the spent helping me in various flags to defeat a boss, and/or acquire charms, gold, experience and/or gems.</p>
