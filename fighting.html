				<h2 class=”pvp”><ins>Player-VS-Player (PVP)</ins></h2>
				<p class="intro">PVP is also called <strong>free-for-all (FFA)</strong> and <strong>team deathmatch (TDM)</strong> in DH4, but most everyone types PVP anyways, and it’s held in the Astral Arena.  You can add anyone as your friend in the lobby (as long as they accept), but only the host of the FFA/TD can kick someone out, and then only from the lobby, which is inaccessible once “start” is pressed.  Both FFA and TDM have a private chat room in the lobby, but it has a short view screen that you cannot scroll at all, and after several messages it stops displaying new ones, so you must exit chat to the lobby and wait until an exclamation mark appears on the chat icon (there will be a click sound, too), at which time you can go back in to see what new comment(s) was added.  It can be nice to use these chat rooms for private conversations, but remember that ANYONE who enters the lobby can enter the chat, too, so you may have to ask them to leave or kick them out!</p>
				<h3>Free-for-All</h3>
				<p>This is accessible from the red flag with crossed swords on the map, or you can access it through the Multiplayer menu.  Exiting or getting kicked out of any game lobby will also take you to the multiplayer menu, where you can scroll through to FFA.  In Free-for-All, you can have up to 6 players, and it’s everyone for themselves.  Each person's character is displayed with a colored circle at their feet, but you cannot tell who they are unless you strike them.  2 gems are awarded to the winner, one to the losers, and in the case of draws, everyone involved earns 2 gems.  There is a graduated system for the fast-kill method (see below).  Please note that if you click the “friends only” option, only people on your friends list can get in, but gems are NOT awarded.</p>
				<h3>Team Deathmatch</h3>
				<p>The only direct way to reach this is via the Multiplayer menu, but you can also reach it by exiting (or getting kicked out of) any game lobby.  There is a button in the bottom-right corner above the settings button which allows you to shift players around from team to team, but only the host can do this.  Teams are differentiated by the colors blue and red.  In Team Deathmatch, you have two teams with a maximum of 3 players on each team and, of course, the goal is to defeat the other team.  Unlike FFA, TDM only awards a single gem.</p>
				<h3>Joining a Match</h3>
				<p>One strange problem with DH4 is that, in general, characters who haven’t finished Hardcore mode CANNOT usually play with higher-level characters, but it is also dependent on your DPS.   I say strange because, in addition to this unclear breakpoint, sometimes low level characters DO manage to get into PVP with very high level ones (which is disastrous for a small player, who cannot possibly win).  Most of the time, though, you’ll get a message saying you can’t join because of "game requirements", or some other error, like "Could not process request."  What is even stranger is that, quite often, players of similar level will ALSO not be able to join PVP with each other.  No one is sure why, but <em>sometimes</em> if you restart DH4, this problem stops.  Sometimes, joining another player allows you to bypass the problem, too.  Sometimes, if you first play a co-op level with the person you’re having trouble going into PVP/TDM helps.</p>

				<p>An irritating problem with dying in FFA and TDM, as well as co-op levels, is that the entire game becomes inaccessible for 5 seconds, excepting the buttons at the bottom, which usually are at least: "Leave", "World Map" and "".  You cannot access your character, inventory, or even chat.</p>

				<p><ins>Fun Fact</ins>:  If you stun someone in PVP, you can actually push them around as long as they are stunned!</p>

				<h3>WarMage Glitch</h3>
					<p>If you’re a fanatic when it comes to PVP, you’ll want to have a WarMage, and load it with stun charms (mind) and a stunning ring.  There is a strange glitch that reduces the amount of damage they take, and/or increases their health a lot to the point that they can be very difficult to kill, even when they’re not a very high level!</p>
