There are a wide range of potions for sale in the shop.  All potions have only a temporary effect and, for the most part are not worth the gold or gems to buy them.  Some potions, the prestige and legacy, are useless because they are tied to events (which are all broken), so you should sell them if you get them.

Elixirs are rare items that have a permanent effect on your character.  Keep and use them right away.  The increase is small, though.
