    			<p>Game Loft’s 4th in the series used to be a popular game but, with the release of DH5, Game Loft has neglected it severely as it focuses on milking the cash out of DH5.  Unfortunately, DH5 is at least as glitch as DH4, if not moreso, so I wasn’t even able to run it on my iPad.  There are still people playing, but it is hard to tell how many people there are because the game doesn’t require you to log into GL or Facebook, and your name can be assigned by either your device or by using the skip button.  Older players are becoming rare:  in the time I’ve been playing, I’ve seen several long-term players disappear out of frustration over typical MPRPGs:  disloyalty, selfishness, trolling, mimicking another user’s screen name, immaturity, hacking the game, and so on.  MerlionROARS aka EugeneEngine aka Canicanican4 aka…was a frequent benefactor for other players, but he quit the end of 2017.  A month or two before that, Grrr left, then AlytheWitch, and it appears that LizzzvonLipwig has left, while Bernd Thielert and Mithgar Nim almost never play now.   Some old players HAVE returned, such as LordVictor and nothinMatters, and several remain, like Thea_Gelo and evan.  Also, the players represent an array of nations: the USA, Canada, the UK, France, Switzerland, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, Brazil, Russia and more!</p>
			<p class=”credits”>Many thanks to Grrr, Bernd, Gene, Lizzz, Thea and evan (and a few others) for the information they shared with me which, along with what I learned by playing and a bit from the DH4 FAQs, is the basis of this webpage.   Thanks go to them (and several others!) for not just the information they shared,  but the time the spent helping me in various flags to defeat a boss, and/or acquire charms, gold, experience and/or gems.</p>

				<h2 class=”gemsQT”><ins>Gems</ins></h2>
				<p class="artIntro">I start with this section because, ultimately, gems are the REAL currency of the game.  They are very valuable, so use them carefully!  Gems are directly purchasable with cash from the In-Apps Screen (touch either the gold, gem or + icon to go there), but you can also earn them.  They are shown as a blue diamond on some screens, including the inventory screen.<br/></p>
				<h3 class=”priorities”>Priorities</h3>
				<p class="priority">Your first priorities for those gems should be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>adding 1 each of the skill slots (active has a max of 3 and passive a max of 4, but they’re not all immediately available for purchase with gems, and some are free);</li>
					<li>adding slots in your backpack (the first is 3 gems and increases by 3 gems for each ensuing slot); and</li>
					<li>getting one of the tier 99 rings ASAP.<br/></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="priority">Secondary priorities for gem use should be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>expanding your inventory further so you have more space to collect and merge charms;</li>
					<li>adding the 4th passive skill slot; and</li>
					<li>buying special weekend challenges to get special charms like monk, ghost and essence;<br/></li>
				</ul>

				<p class="priority">The only tertiary priorities would be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>buying skill points;</li>
					<li>buying extra character slots; or</li>
					<li>resetting all your skills (this gets more expensive the more skill points you use, so try to upgrade skills wisely).<br/></li>

				<h3 class=”dont”>DON’Ts</h3>
					<p> class="priority">Do <strong>not</strong> waste gems on things like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>speeding up charm merges, charm removals and equipment upgrades,</li>
					<li>buying equipment from the store for regular usage (except for special weekend challenges), and</li>
<li>the vanity armor located in the shop (the face mask icon to the far right), etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=”gettingGems”>Earning Gems</h3>
There are only a few ways to get gems other than purchasing them with real money.
<ol>
	<li>Free-for-all in the Astral Arena (see PVP/FFA & TDM)</li>
	<li>The regular weekend challenge (see challenges)</li>
</ol>
The game claims you can also get 100 gems by linking your Facebook account to DH4 but, when I tried, I didn’t get any.

<h2 class=”Eternal”><ins>Eternal Battle</ins></h2>

<h2 class=”pvp”><ins>Player-VS-Player (PVP)</ins></h2>
PVP is also called free-for-all (FFA) and team deathmatch (TDM) in DH4, but most everyone says PVP anyways, and it’s held in the Astral Arena.  You can add anyone as your friend in the lobby (as long as they accept), but only the host of the FFA/TD can kick someone out, and then only from the lobby, which is inaccessible once “start” is pressed.  Both FFA and TDM have a private chat room in the lobby, but it has a short view screen that you cannot scroll at all, and after several messages it stops displaying new ones, so you must exit chat to the lobby and wait until an exclamation mark appears on the chat icon (there will be a click sound, too), at which time you can go back in to see what new comment(s) was added.  It can be nice to use these chat rooms for private conversations, but remember that ANYONE who enters the lobby can enter the chat, too, so you may have to ask them to leave or kick them out!

In Free-for-all, you can have up to 6 players, and it’s everyone for themselves.  Each person is given a colored circle at their feet, but you cannot tell who they are unless you strike them.  This is accessible from the red flag with crossed swords on the map, or you can access it through the Multiplayer menu.  Exiting or getting kicked out of any game lobby will also take you to the multiplayer menu, where you can scroll through to FFA.  Please note that if you click the “friends only” option, only people on your friends list can get in, but gems are NOT awarded.


In Team Deathmatch, you have two teams with a maximum of 3 players on each team.  There is a button in the bottom right corner above the settings button which allows you to shift players around from team to team, but only the host can do this.  Teams are differentiated by the colors blue and red.  The only direct way to reach this is via the Multiplayer menu, but you can also reach it by exiting (or getting kicked out of) any game lobby.

One strange problem with DH4 is that, in general, characters who haven’t finished Hardcore mode CANNOT usually play with higher-level characters, but it is also dependent on your DPS.   I say strange because, in addition to this unclear breakpoint, sometimes low level characters DO manage to get into PVP with very high level ones (which is disastrous for the small player, who cannot possibly win).  Most of the time, though, you’ll get a message saying you can’t join because of game requirements.  What is even stranger is that, quite often, players of similar level will ALSO not be able to join PVP with each other.  No one is sure why, but <em>sometimes</em> if you restart DH4, this problem stops.  Sometimes, joining another player allows you to bypass the problem, too.  Sometimes, if you first play a co-op level with the person you’re having trouble going into PVP/TDM helps.

Fun Fact:  If you stun someone in PVP, you can actually push them around as long as they are stunned!
WarMage Glitch
If you’re a fanatic when it comes to PVP, you’ll want to have a WarMage, and load it with stun charms (mind) and a stunning ring.  There is a strange glitch that reduces the amount of damage they take, and/or increases their health a lot to the point that they can be very difficult to kill, even when they’re not a very high level!

Getting Gems
As per the information in the lobby of the astral arena, whoever gets the most kills gets 2 gems and everyone else gets one.   Each session lasts 5 minutes although, in reality, the first few seconds are wasted by the game.  There are, in reality, 3 other options:
<ul>
	<li>No Kill and Draw:  Everyone sits around and no one kills anyone else.  This is great if you need to have your attention focused elsewhere for 5 minutes at a pop, but can be kind of boring, so you might want to buy tier 9 “sly” equipment from the lobby shop before entering – then you can slap each other around without actually, although it doesn’t nullify your stun ability, ring, active skills and spirit spell!  This ends up being the equivalent of a draw and, as a result, everyone gets 2 gems.  If you want to play to a draw, everyone has to keep careful count to ensure everyone has the same number of kills, else only one person gets 2 gems!</li>

	<li>Fast/Quick Kill:  You’ll need at least 3 players but 6 will yield the most gems for all.  One person, preferably a person with at least 1,500,000 DPS, should be designated the killer.  If there are other higher-level players with high-tier armor, they should go into the shop and purchase the lowest available in order to facilitate the killing.</li>
</ul>


<h2 class=”rings”> <ins>Rings</ins></h2>
Most people suggest the cinder ring, which is the most expensive and, for most purposes, the best, but the Snakeheart ring is best for PVP.  Some of the other higher-tier rings below 99 are nice, but they really aren’t worth it: see my spreadsheet to understand why!   Getting one of these rings early in your character’s development can make a big difference.

<h2 class=”potions”> <ins>Potions</ins></h2>
There are a wide range of potions for sale in the shop.  All potions have only a temporary effect and, for the most part are not worth the gold or gems to buy them.  Some potions, the prestige and legacy, are useless because they are tied to events (which are all broken), so you should sell them if you get them.

<h2 class=”elixirs”> <ins>Elixirs</ins></h2>
Elixirs are rare items that have a permanent effect on your character.  Keep and use them right away.  The increase is small, though.

<h2 class=”chests”> <ins>Book of Skills</ins></h2>
You will sometimes get this from the bronze chest.  Use it right away to get two extra skill points!

<h2 class=”SP”> <ins>Skill Points</ins></h2>
You can get skill points by buying them with gems, but this is very costly, so you’re better off planning carefully.  Not all skills are worth investing in, so you’ll need to look online for information for the skills in your class, and carefully calculate (yes, use math!) which will give you the best value.  Some people don’t like it, but if you want to progress through levels quickly, one of the first passive skills you get increases the amount of experience you earn from killing a monster.
As a general rule, it’s better to put your skill points into the best passive skills instead of active ones since they don’t cost energy and help you at all times.

<h2 class=”items”> <ins>Equipment</ins></h2>
Buying
Generally speaking, you should be able to get the equipment you need from monsters as you progress however, if you get to a point where you’re having trouble beating a boss, it may be time to buy (using gold) a significantly higher tier weapon than you currently have.  I know this worked wonders for my efforts to kill Ustrak the Devourer in Banner (aka Flag) 13: Kankheer!

The only time you’ll want to buy equipment with gems will be later once you’ve fulfilled the main priorities for gem usage, so that you can purchase the special weapons required for the weekend challenge that earns you a special charm (monk, ghost, essence and scavenger).  Once you buy one of these gems, do NOT sell them.

Selling
Selling is a simple matter:  sell all equipment you get that isn’t at least 10 tiers higher than what you have, unless it already has 2-3 charm slots; the gold and time needed to remove unwanted charms and upgrade the item when your character is small isn’t worth it otherwise!  Higher is ALWAYS better in this game – there are no cursed items – but once you reach the top of the tiers, you’re only looking for tier 97 Sanguine weapons and tier 101 pelt armor.  These are one step above the Saintly armor you  should’ve made once you had enough spirit stones.
Charms in Equipment
Most of the time, you should sell off any equipment you buy without removing charms.  I know you may feel tempted to grab that power charm, but trust me – I speak from experience – you’re wasting gold, time, and inventory slots.  This is true unless you find specific charms that are hard to get, primarily: winter, storm, perception and bandit.  If it is ANY other charm you NEED and it is not at least 5th level, don’t bother!  Bandit, especially, should always be removed because it almost never appears as a charm dropped by a monster, whereas all the other non-special charms (including mind, which you may want to collect for the stun ability after you’ve gotten all your other important charms maxed out).
Crafting
Save all the material you get from monsters; do not use it to make weapons and armor until you have already made your saintly armor and weapon – then feel free to use your excess to make whatever is required for a weekend or weekday challenge.

<h2 class=”tab”> <ins>Black & White Tab on the Left Side of the World Map</ins></h2>
Click it to open/close it.  This contains various options:  Achievements, DH4 &  Me, Multiplayer, Leaderboards, Social, Crafting and Options.

<h2 class=”events”> <ins>Events</ins></h2>
Events no longer function in DH4.

<h2 class=”challenges”> <ins>Challenges</ins></h2>
There are three kinds, and you should participate in the regular ones every chance you get.  The special one requires that you spend gems to get a special weapon (which you can keep and reuse), so you won’t be able to join in for a while unless you can accumulate gems quickly.

<h2 class=”chests”> <ins>Chests</ins></h2>
You may sometimes see system notes during loads that mention wheels and lotteries.  These don’t exist anymore – but there are still the bronze, silver and gold chests within the “Chest of Fate”, which you can access from the menu at the top of the World Map and the Challenges Screen.  These chests are basically gambling – you can spend huge sums of gems and not get what you want (e.g. you get the armor you want but with the wrong charm slots); it can be extremely frustrating and some players won’t talk about how much they’ve wasted.
The gold chest is the most expensive (1 chance for 500 gems, 6 for 2,500), but it offers the chance of winning great prizes, such as the best armor (Leviathan - tier 103) and hexagonal charms.  You get ONE free draw from this chest for each character.
The silver chest is less expensive (1 draw for 200 and 6 for 1,000 respectively), and offers very nice armor (Crimson – tier 97), special charms (essence, ghost, monk and scavenger) and expensive potions.
The bronze chest is inexpensive (1 draw for 50 and 5 for 250) and has a variety of gifts: special and normal charms that are rare, elixirs and potions, and the coveted book of skills (which gives you 2 skill points).  You get one free draw per day, but it is not exactly cumulative; if you miss a day or two, you will get more than one draw that day, but after a period of time.  Most of the time, you’ll get common charms and potions but, every once in a while (almost weekly), you’ll get the book and, less often, you’ll get an elixir, and super rarely a special charm.  Be careful NOT to draw when you have less than the minimum number of health potions as, most often, the chest will give you a health potion.


<h2 class=”charms”> Charms</ins></h2>
Please see my Charms spreadsheet for technical info.

Hexagonal
You will probably find an item (usually leg armor) with a hexagonal charm slot in it, and you will be able to add 3 other slots to it.  Do not hold onto this waiting for hex charms – they are only available within the .  You can’t even get them as a gift.
Standard
These are: 
Circular: fortitude, power, agility, arcana,
Square: wisdom, heart, soul, bandit,
Triangular: 
Star: winter, storm, soldier, blessing, 
Special
These are: monk, ghost, essence and scavenger, but the latter doesn’t function anymore.  You should always keep these if you get them as they are very useful, except the latter.
<h2 class=”gifts”> <ins>Gifts</ins></h2>

<h2 class=”guilds”> <ins>Guilds</ins></h2>

<h2 class=”chat”> <ins>Chat</ins></h2>
Global Chat
Guild Chat
FFA/TD/Co-op Chat
<h2 class=”DPS”> <ins>Damage Per Second (DPS)</ins></h2>

<h2 class=”Dmg”> <ins>Damage <ins></h2>
There are two different classes of damage: immediate and delayed.
Immediate: lightning, radiant, ice and damage bonuses.  
Delayed: poison (over 4 seconds), bleed (over 3 seconds), fire (over 2 seconds).  These do not “stack” with other types of damage.
Some of these increase your DPS a lot, some a little, and they affect different types of monsters differently.  For example, ice will not be very effective on cold region monsters (kenashi, ravagers, wolves, lupines) whereas fire will.  Radiant is most effective against the undead and demons.
<h2 class=”storydiff”> <ins>The Story, Game Modes & Difficulty Levels</ins></h2>
The game’s story progresses through 20 main flags (green solo story, blue solo/co-op story) and several additional flags (purple solo/co-op staged battles, black solo/co-op boss battles) tied to the main story flags, plus there are two unique flags (orange eternal battle solo/co-op staged battles, red PVP). 
You start the game in “Normal Mode.”  Once you have completed the first 18 main flags (most people are surprised by how easy it is to defeat Drall), you are given the option of moving to “Hardcore Mode”.   If you choose not to do so at that time, you can always do so from the Character menu.  However, there is no real reason not to switch.  After that, you can complete the last 2 main flags, although you don’t have to complete flag 20: Spirit Temple in order to restart in Hardcore.  Hardcore isn’t really that much harder than normal, except for on the higher levels and special flags.

As a rule of thumb, once you’ve completed hardcore, you’ll be able to join in FFA & TDM with any high level player, whereas before that you will almost never be able to successfully join (unless your DPS is very high) with anyone outside of about +/-10 levels of you.

You’ll notice when you start playing that each level has 5 stars on the map, but only one star is golden.  Once you complete normal mode, you’ll be able to select the level of difficulty for any flag: normal, elite, heroic, legendary, or godlike, and each difficulty will show the suggested character level for it, although this won’t apply if you’ve done well in developing your character’s skills and equipment.  Each difficulty level has its own objectives, which you can view by touching the map in the top-right corner of the level screen, which will also show the map of the level – at least, as much of it as you’ve explored (including from previous attempts).

<h2 class=”inet”> <ins>Internet: Wifi/Data Access</ins></h2>
There are two ways to connect to the Internet: via wifi and using your data access from your provider.  Wifi is more reliable and less expensive when playing online.  If you minimize your game or access another function of your device, and you are in a multiplayer activity, you will be disconnected from the activity.
If you want to play offline, you can continue to play solo but some things will not work: merging charms, adding/removing charms, adding friends, upgrading items, adding friends, all chat areas, all multiplayer areas (FFA,TDM, co-op).  Some of them, such as completing the merger/addition/removal of charms and item upgrades, and sending gifts, will complete when you are online.

If you are connected to a network, you can still play multi-player games with people on your network.  Select “local” instead of “online”.
