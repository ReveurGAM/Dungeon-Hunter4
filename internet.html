<h2 class=”internet”> <ins>Internet: Wifi/Data Access</ins></h2>
There are two ways to connect to the Internet: via wifi and using your data access from your provider.  Wifi is more reliable and less expensive when playing online.  If you minimize your game or access another function of your device, and you are in a multiplayer activity, you will be disconnected from the activity.
If you want to play offline, you can continue to play solo but some things will not work: merging charms, adding/removing charms, adding friends, upgrading items, adding friends, all chat areas, all multiplayer areas (FFA,TDM, co-op).  Some of them, such as completing the merger/addition/removal of charms and item upgrades, and sending gifts, will complete when you are online.

If you are connected to a network, you can still play multi-player games with people on your network.  Select “local” instead of “online”.
