Buying
Generally speaking, you should be able to get the equipment you need from monsters as you progress however, if you get to a point where you’re having trouble beating a boss, it may be time to buy (using gold) a significantly higher tier weapon than you currently have.  I know this worked wonders for my efforts to kill Ustrak the Devourer in Banner (aka Flag) 13: Kankheer!

The only time you’ll want to buy equipment with gems will be later once you’ve fulfilled the main priorities for gem usage, so that you can purchase the special weapons required for the weekend challenge that earns you a special charm (monk, ghost, essence and scavenger).  Once you buy one of these gems, do NOT sell them.

Selling
Selling is a simple matter:  sell all equipment you get that isn’t at least 10 tiers higher than what you have, unless it already has 2-3 charm slots; the gold and time needed to remove unwanted charms and upgrade the item when your character is small isn’t worth it otherwise!  Higher is ALWAYS better in this game – there are no cursed items – but once you reach the top of the tiers, you’re only looking for tier 97 Sanguine weapons and tier 101 pelt armor.  These are one step above the Saintly armor you  should’ve made once you had enough spirit stones.
Charms in Equipment
Most of the time, you should sell off any equipment you buy without removing charms.  I know you may feel tempted to grab that power charm, but trust me – I speak from experience – you’re wasting gold, time, and inventory slots.  This is true unless you find specific charms that are hard to get, primarily: winter, storm, perception and bandit.  If it is ANY other charm you NEED and it is not at least 5th level, don’t bother!  Bandit, especially, should always be removed because it almost never appears as a charm dropped by a monster, whereas all the other non-special charms (including mind, which you may want to collect for the stun ability after you’ve gotten all your other important charms maxed out).
Crafting
Save all the material you get from monsters; do not use it to make weapons and armor until you have already made your saintly armor and weapon – then feel free to use your excess to make whatever is required for a weekend or weekday challenge.
