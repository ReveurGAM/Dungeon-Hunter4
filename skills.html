<p>Skills allow you to do special things, and come in three categories:  Active, Passive and Spirit Spells.</p>


	There are a limited number of slots available for Active and Passive, but Spirit Spells only get one.</p>
<p>Active has a max of 3 and passive a max of 4, but they’re not all immediately available for purchase with gems, and some are free)</p>

<h3 class="sp">Skill Points</h3>

<p>You can get skill points by buying them with gems, but this is very costly, so you’re better off planning carefully.  Not all skills are worth investing in, so you’ll need to look online for information for the skills in your class, and carefully calculate (yes, use math!) which will give you the best value.  Some people don’t like it, but if you want to progress through levels quickly, one of the first passive skills you get increases the amount of experience you earn from killing a monster.</p>
<p>As a general rule, it’s better to put your skill points into the best passive skills instead of active ones since they don’t cost energy and help you at all times.</p>
