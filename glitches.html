    <h2 class=”glitches”>Glitches</h2>
    <p>I have been playing DH4 since October 2017 and have noticed plenty of problems. The following is a list of many of the glitches, [with a solution in brackets, or multiple solutions listed in order, if any exist].  Some are minor inconveniences, while others require that you exit your flag, restart the game, or even restart your device.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All events are broken; only the challenges remain [no solution]</li>
        <img src="Images/events/Event currently unavailable message.png" alt="Event currently unavailable message" />
        <li>Invisible stage-continuation crystals. [Shoot where they should be; if that doesn't work, then you must exit the level.]</li>
        <li>Invisible totem pole with radius rings. [Try shooting where it should be, otherwise it'll disappear when its time limit is reached.]</li>
        <li>Invisible NPC enemy (but there is a red dot on the mini-map). [Kill it. if you can't, then escape it but, if you must kill it to continue, then you must exit the level.]</li>
        <li>Invisible gold. [Collect it.]</li>
        <img src="Images/glitches/Glitch-invisible-gold-on-vent.png" alt="Invisible gold" />
        <li>Suddenly being unable to rejoin a game with someone you were just playing with due to “game requirements not being met” or other error. [Try playing a different type of co-op level with the same person. Switch characters. Close game and reopen it then try. Restart your device, start the game and try. Keep trying or play in another area.]</li>
        <p>{Note that you may get the error shown below when trying to join a PVP match because your level and/or DPS must be within an unknown range of the player who is hosting in order to join (if your character is still small).  However, an exception seems to exist for level 20 characters.  Around the time you complete hardcore mode, you should be able to play with anyone near your level or higher...except for when this glitch happens, which is often.}</p>
        <img src="Images/errors/Game-requirements-not-met.png" alt="Game requirements not met error message" />
        <li>Being unable to join someone in free-for-all (FFA) and/or team deathmatch (TDM). [Follow the instructions for the previous glitch.]</li>
        <li>If you press the "start" or "accept" button too quickly, the program won't be ready and you'll get an error similar to this:</li>
        <img src="Images/errors/Could not process request.png" alt="Could not process request error message" />
        <li>Being unable to log into your account or profile [<strong id="andor">AND/OR:</strong> Check that your wifi/data connection is on. Turn your wifi/data connection off and on. If you have a VPN, turn it off and on. Reload the game. Restart your device.]</li>
        <img src="Images/errors/Username or password error message.png" alt="Username or password error message" />
        <li>Entering a multiplayer area (most often, the astral arena where FFA aka PVP is played out) and there is no terrain, with or without background/sky, wherein you cannot go anywhere or do anything although your character's body moves. [If there is a timer, wait to get your gems.]</li>
        <img src="Images/glitches/Glitch Arena with timer.png" alt="Arena with timer but no terrain glitch" />
        <p>[If there is no timer, or you did not enter a timed level, exit.]</p>
        <img src="Images/glitches/Glitch Arena without timer.png" alt="Arena without timer and terrain glitch" vspace=10px/>
        <img src="Images/glitches/Glitch no terrain or background.png" alt="No terrain or background glitch" />
        <li>The guild I created, and my friends list, disappeared once, during which time I joined someone else’s guild, only to have both reappear later on.  This sometimes causes a conflict wherein the game asks if your name (account) is yours, then logs you out and tells you that you can't be in two guilds.  This can also happen if you have multiple identical devices on the same Apple ID, such as two iPads. [Either exit the second guild or keep both and deal with this infrequent error by following these <a href="#andor">and/or instructions</a>.]</li>
        <img src="Images/errors/#" alt="Logged out because you're in two guilds error message" />
        <li>A large number of my gems suddenly disappeared, although that could’ve been my son using gems when his health potions ran out but he kept clicking it. [If you're sharing the device with another person who is also playing DH4, talk and inform him/her that the gems are in a shared pool and figure out an equitable plan together, otherwise there is no solution.] </li>
        <li>Suddenly being unable to take any action (this is exclusively in multi-player games, and usually happens after performing certain menu actions). [Exit the level.]</li>
        <li>Monsters cease attacking (happens after certain menu actions are performed), which will eventually stop you from proceeding. [Exit the level.]</li>
        <img src="Images/glitches/glitch non-violent monster.png" alt="Monsters cease attacking glitch" />
        <li>Gifts not being shown when you click on the message and the notification being delayed for hours or even days. [Sometimes going into the social menu in the tab causes received gifts to be displayed.] </li>
        <li>The game cannot distinguish properly between two different devices using the same email/user name, hence sometimes both will be logged out and, therefore, unable to access online features, for example. [Follow these <a href="#andor">and/or instructions</a>.]</li>
        <img src="Images/errors/No internet connection.png" alt="No internet connection error message" />
        <li>For the first couple of months of play, especially when playing for a long time and late at night, the in-app purchases screen randomly pops up more and more frequently, and restarting the game doesn’t help. [Endure it or give up when it interfers with game play too much. After 2-3 months, this nuisance should stop happening (it's probably like nagware, rather than a glitch);</li>
        <img src="Images/in-app-purchases/In-App Purchase.png" alt="In-App Purchases screen appeared without being accessed" />
        <li>Usually invitations and gift notifications are minimized on the left side in the form of a bust with a red exclamation mark but they sometimes open by themselves while you are fighting, blocking part of the screen and preventing you from fighting until you close it; this can lead to death!; </li>
        <img src="Images/errors/Play-invitation.png" alt="Play together invitation from another player" />
        <li>DPS not being the same between its two display points (inventory and the character panel). [Wait and eventually they will be the same. Trust the character panel.]</li>
        <li>The warmage (WM) PVP glitch wherein a WM sustains far less damage than they should – one person estimates ¼. [Use a WM and avoid PVP with them.]</li>
        <li>There are secret glitches I’ve promised not to reveal. [????]</li>
        <li>Suddenly being transported a large distance through walls and other barriers.[No solution.]</li>
        <li>Being disconnected from a game for no reason. [Rejoin.]</li>
        <li>Being unable to click next at the end of a co-op game, even when you were invited. [Rejoin.]</li>
        <li>Sometimes you won't get the charm shown as the reward for the charm challenge - you'll get a different special one. [Cry.]</li>
    </ul>
<hr/>
    <p>In addition, some people have reported glitches like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Character(s) being reset to level 1. [If someone tells you that your level is shown as 0 for an extended period of time in a level, exit the level before it ends to prevent this from happening - thanks MerlionROARS!]</li>
        <li>Friends list is not functioning. [Unknown, but try following these <a href="#andor">and/or instructions</a>.]</li>
        <li>Scavenger charm not working right. [Unknown.] </li>
        <li>Guild being deleted. [Unknown, but try following these <a href="#andor">and/or instructions</a>.]</li>
        <li>Screen name showing up in global chat as _______. [Change your font.]</li>
        <li>Not being able to open a bronze, silver or gold chest. [Unknown.]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Feel free to report these and other glitches to Game Loft.</p>
